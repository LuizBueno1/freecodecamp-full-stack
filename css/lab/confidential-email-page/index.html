        <h1>Top Secret – Do not open without grease-proof gloves</h1>
        <p>Ahoy, future guardian of the ultimate recipe! If you're reading this, either I trusted you too much… or you
            broke into my drawer locked with reinforced seaweed chains. Either way, the fate of the Krabby Patty now
            rests in your claws. The formula is hidden in three parts, encrypted with mystic ingredients that must never
            be spoken aloud, especially the <span class="blurred">flaming coral seasoning</span>.</p>
        <p>The first step is to extract the <span class="blurred">marine bubble extract</span>, but only under the light
            of a full moon and
            the sound of a whale’s song. Without it, the flavor ends up like Squidward’s gym socks. Remember: everything
            must be mixed in an ancestral shell bowl, found deep within Abyssal Trench 9.</p>
        <p>Finally, never — and I repeat, never — reveal the final touch: the <span class="blurred">secret krabby-sauce
                surprise</span>. This
            part is the heart of the formula, capable of making any sea creature sell their soul for a bite. If this
            letter falls into the wrong hands… well, kiss your appetite and the Krusty Krab’s customers goodbye.</p>
