    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>For the caramel:</p>
            <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
        <p>for the flan:</p>
            <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk (14 oz or 395 g)</li>
            <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Caramel</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar and water. Stir gently until the sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Let it cook without stirring until the mixture turns a golden amber color. Be careful not to let it burn.</li>
            <li>Quickly pour the caramel into a round baking pan (about 8-9 inches in diameter), tilting the pan to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside to cool and harden.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the Flan Mixture</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a blender, combine the sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, eggs, and vanilla extract (if using). Blend for 1-2 minutes until smooth and well mixed.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into the caramel-coated pan. This step ensures a silky texture by removing any egg lumps.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake the Flan</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>Place the baking pan in a larger baking dish. Fill the larger dish with hot water, creating a water bath (bain-marie). This helps the flan cook evenly and prevents cracking.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 1 hour or until the flan is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cool and Serve</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the pan from the water bath and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for the best texture and flavor.</li>
            <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the flan to loosen it. Place a plate on top of the pan and carefully invert it. The caramel will flow over the flan, creating a beautiful topping.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
